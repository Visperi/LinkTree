A simple project of a "virtual business card". Made mainly as a Proof of Concept project utilizing C++ and Qt with QML.

I have some plans on improving this project which I may or may not implement in the future.

# Requirements

**Qt6 is required**

This project *should* be cross-platform, as no platform specific components have been used as far as I know.

## Compiling

To compile in Qt Creator, just clone the repository and open `CMakeLists.txt` in the editor. Source and required files are configured to be included automatically.
